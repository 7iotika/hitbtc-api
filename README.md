hitbtc API - streaming market data and trading 
================================

### General considerations

Streaming API is based on [WebSocket protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

The following symbols are traded on hitbtc exchange.

| Symbol	| Lot size | Price step
| --- | --- | --- |
| BTCUSD |	0.01 BTC |	0.01 |
| BTCEUR |	0.01 BTC |	0.01 |
| EURUSD | 1 EUR |	0.0001 |

Size values in messages are represented in lots.

### Market data end-point

URL: [ws://api.hitbtc.com](ws://api.hitbtc.com)

Once client connects to this URL the session is started. 

The server broadcasts the following types of messages:

* [MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh](#MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh) message contains a full snapshot of the order book.
* [MarketDataIncrementalRefresh](#MarketDataIncrementalRefresh) message contains incremental changes

Some recommendations to consider:

* The application could receive the first snapshot and maintain the order book by applying incremental updates
* It's recommended to invalidate a state of the application periodically using snapshots
* It's recommended to check sequence numbers and to drop updates with non-increasing sequence numbers
